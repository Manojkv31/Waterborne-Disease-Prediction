# Waterborne Disease Prediction

 This project is mainly focussed on predicting two waterborne diseases, viz. Malaria and Typhoid.
 Various Machine Learning models as well as ensemble classifiers were trained to predict the presence of waterborne diseases.
 In order to figure out the most important features, **Random Forest Classifier** was used for **Feature Selection**.
 Machine Learning Algorithms used are:
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine(SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN)
* Voting Classifier
* AdaBoost
